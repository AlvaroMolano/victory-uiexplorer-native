# Victory Native UIExplorer

Victory Native UIExplorer is a React Native app for iOS and Android that showcases Victory Native components. Each example has controls that toggle and animate between sample datasets and other configuration and style properties to give you a taste of what's possible in the Victory Native world of mobile data visualization. The API for Victory Native is identical to Victory, so you can do all the same stuff that you love in the browser on iOS or Android. For more information, check out the Victory docs: http://formidable.com/open-source/victory.
